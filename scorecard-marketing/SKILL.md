# Scorecard Marketing Skill

A proven 4-step system for generating qualified leads through interactive assessments. This approach generates warm leads with rich data about each prospect.

## Core Philosophy

**Everything is downstream from lead generation.** People buy to resolve psychological tension between their current reality and desired reality. A scorecard awakens dormant desires by asking revealing questions.

Key insight: While people actively searching are harder to sell to (already decided, set budget), those with dormant desires buy from whoever helped them uncover the need.

## The 4-Step Scorecard System

### Step 1: Landing Page

**Purpose:** Get visitors to start the questionnaire.

**Required elements:**

1. **Concept Hook** - What would your ideal customers want to score themselves on?
   - Moving toward: "Are you ready to [goal]?"
   - Removing pain: "Reduce your [frustration] - take this quiz"
   - Readiness check: "Should you [big decision]? Complete this checklist"
   - Category discovery: "What type of [X] are you?"
   - Knowledge test: "Test your [topic] expertise"

2. **The 3 Cs:**
   - **Clarity** - List specific benefits, pain points removed, what they'll learn
   - **Credibility** - Years of experience, clients served, awards, research
   - **Connection** - Friendly photos, colors matching target audience

3. **CTA Button** - "Start the Quiz" / "Discover Your Score" / "Take the Assessment"

4. **Time expectation** - "Takes less than 3 minutes"

**Bonuses to offer:** Free book, consultation, event ticket, exclusive report

### Step 2: Questionnaire

**Goal:** Fast, fun, focused on problems and results.

**Lead capture form first:** Name, email, optional phone. Even if they abandon, you have their info.

**Question types:**

| Type | Use for | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Yes/No | Checklist items | "Do you work out 3+ times/week?" |
| Sliding scale | Degree/frequency | "How important is X to you?" |
| Radio buttons | Single choice | "Which best describes your situation?" |
| Checkboxes | Multiple selections | "Which tools do you use?" |
| Open text | Rare, slows completion | "What has stopped you in the past?" |

**Question count by funnel stage:**

| Stage | Categories | Questions | Purpose |
|-------|------------|-----------|---------|
| Cold → Warm | 1-3 | 8-15 | First interaction, quick value |
| Warm → Sales | 3-7 | 20-50 | Pre-qualify for sales meeting |
| Client → Fan | 3-10 | 30-150 | Comprehensive assessment, track progress |

**Categories:** Group questions into 2-7 measurable areas (e.g., Marketing, Operations, Leadership)

**Scoring:** Assign 1-5 points per answer based on importance. Weight significant answers higher.

**Avoid:**
- Overly salesy questions ("Are you ready to buy?")
- Leading questions 
- Questions requiring lookup ("When does your contract expire?")
- Industry jargon prospects won't understand

**Pro tip:** Add qualifying questions in "Uncategorised": budget, urgency, company size

### Step 3: Results Page

**Purpose:** Deliver value, create tension to improve, guide next steps.

**Show:**
1. **Overall score** - Total across all categories
2. **Category scores** - Breakdown showing strengths/weaknesses
3. **Dynamic content** - Personalized insights based on scoring tier

**Scoring tiers:** 
- Default: Low / Medium / High
- Custom: "Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced" or "Startup / Scaleup / Performer / Unicorn"

**Dynamic content per tier:**

```
Low tier: "This area needs attention. Here are easy first steps... 
         Our team specializes in helping people at your stage."

High tier: "Excellent foundation! Focus on maintaining standards. 
          We work with advanced clients like yourself on [specific advanced offer]."
```

**Sweet spot:** Ideal client scores "strong foundations with room to improve"

**PDF Report (optional):** Personalized cover, detailed recommendations, printable for sales meetings

**Clear CTA:** Different offers per tier:
- Low: Free event ticket, beginner content
- Medium: Book + discovery call
- High: Direct consultation, premium offer

### Step 4: Sales & Marketing

**Promotion channels:**
- LinkedIn posts with poll asking which concept they prefer
- Facebook/Google ads leading to landing page
- Email to existing list
- Mention in podcasts/videos with CTA "Take the scorecard"
- Book QR code linking to related scorecard

**Follow-up:**
- Automated email with results + PDF
- Abandon email if questionnaire incomplete
- Segmented nurture campaigns based on score
- Sales outreach to high-qualifiers with their data visible

**Sales conversation advantage:** You already know their scores, pain points, and qualifying info before the call.
