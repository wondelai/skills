# Scorecard Marketing Skill

A proven 4-step system for generating qualified leads through interactive assessments that arrive with rich data about each prospect.

## Core Principle

**Everything is downstream from lead generation.** People buy to resolve psychological tension between their current reality and desired reality — a scorecard awakens dormant desires by asking revealing questions.

**The foundation:** Active searchers are harder to sell to (already decided, set budget); people with dormant desires buy from whoever helped them uncover the need. Interactive assessments create psychological engagement static content cannot — which is why they convert several times better than a PDF download (see [Conversion Benchmarks](#conversion-benchmarks)).

## Scoring

**Goal: 10/10.** Score a funnel against the six [Quick Diagnostic](#quick-diagnostic) rows: `score = round(satisfied_rows / 6 × 10)`. Read the bands as: **9-10** = all six pass (dormant-desire hook, email captured first, scored categories, unique per-tier content and CTA, tier-segmented follow-up); **5-7** = the funnel exists but generic results or late email capture cost it 2-3 rows; **≤3** = no concept hook or no scoring. Always give the current score and the specific rows to close to reach 10/10.

## The 4-Step Scorecard System

### 1. Landing Page

**Core concept:** The landing page exists for one purpose: get visitors to start the questionnaire. It must create enough curiosity and promise enough value that clicking "Start" feels irresistible.

**Why it works:** A concept hook taps a dormant desire; framing around a score triggers the primal drive to measure, rank, and improve. Curiosity plus low commitment ("takes 3 minutes") removes friction.

**Key insights:**
- The concept hook is the single most important element — it defines what visitors score themselves on. The 5 hook types: **moving toward** (goal), **pain removal**, **readiness** (decision validation), **category** (compare yourself to a standard), **knowledge** (test what you know)
- "Moving toward" hooks ("Are you ready to [goal]?") outperform fear-based hooks
- The 3 Cs — Clarity, Credibility, Connection — must all be present
- Bonuses (free book, consultation, report) lift completion; a time expectation ("less than 3 minutes") reduces abandonment

**Product applications:**

| Context | Landing Page Element | Example |
|---------|---------------------|---------|
| **Concept hook** | Frame around a score visitors want | "What's Your Marketing Score?" |
| **Moving toward** | Goal-oriented hook | "Are you ready to scale your business?" |
| **Readiness check** | Decision validation hook | "Should you launch a second location? Complete this checklist" |

**Copy patterns:**
- "[HEADLINE: Concept hook + promise] Are you ready to [desired outcome]?"
- "Answer [X] quick questions to discover [specific insight] and get personalized recommendations"
- "[CTA BUTTON] Start the Quiz (Takes less than 3 minutes)"

**Ethical boundary:** The hook must promise value the assessment actually delivers — never bait-and-switch into a sales pitch disguised as results.

See [references/industry-examples.md](references/industry-examples.md) when you need a starting hook for a specific niche — 50+ scorecard concepts and landing-page headlines across industries.

### 2. Questionnaire

**Core concept:** The questionnaire collects lead data while providing a gamified experience: capture contact information first, then ask scored questions grouped into categories that surface pain points, desires, and qualification signals.

**Why it works:** People enjoy answering questions about themselves (self-referential encoding), and capturing email before questions retains the lead even on abandonment. Scored categories make results feel scientific, increasing trust in the recommendations.

**Key insights:**
- Lead capture form goes first (name, email, optional phone)
- Question count scales with funnel stage: 8-15 cold-to-warm, 20-50 warm-to-sales, 30-150 client-to-fan
- Group questions into 2-7 measurable categories; assign 1-5 points per answer, weighting significant answers higher
- Add qualifying questions (budget, urgency, company size) in an "Uncategorised" group
- Avoid salesy, leading, lookup, and jargon questions

**Product applications:**

| Context | Question Type | Example |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| **Yes/No** | Checklist items | "Do you work out 3+ times/week?" |
| **Sliding scale** | Degree/frequency | "How important is X to you?" |
| **Open text** | Rare — slows completion | "What has stopped you in the past?" |

**Copy patterns:**
- Use "you" language: "How confident are you in your..." not "Rate your confidence level in..."
- Progress indicators ("Question 5 of 12") reduce abandonment; "Almost done!" maintains momentum
- Category names should be meaningful to the respondent, not internal jargon

**Ethical boundary:** Don't collect data you won't use to improve their results — every qualifying question (budget, urgency, size) must visibly shape the recommendation, not just route them to sales.

See [references/psychology.md](references/psychology.md) when writing or critiquing questions — the tension taxonomy (pain/desire/frustration), the 4-6 quantification sweet spot, and the personalization stats.

### 3. Results Page

**Core concept:** The results page delivers personalized value based on the respondent's score, creating tension between where they are and where they could be, with a clear next step calibrated to their tier.

**Why it works:** Scored, personalized results feel more valuable than generic advice and trigger the drive to improve (see [Psychology](#psychology-behind-why-this-works) below).

**Key insights:**
- Show overall score plus category breakdown to highlight strengths and weaknesses
- Write dynamic content per tier — default Low / Medium / High; custom tiers ("Startup / Scaleup / Performer / Unicorn") increase engagement
- The sweet spot: prospects scoring "strong foundations with room to improve" convert best
- PDF reports (personalized cover, detailed recommendations) extend value and travel into sales meetings
- Different CTAs per tier: Low → free event; Medium → book + discovery call; High → direct consultation

**Product applications:**

| Context | Results Element | Example |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| **Overall score** | Total across categories | "Your Marketing Score: 67/100" |
| **Category breakdown** | Visual strengths/weaknesses | Spider chart of 5 category scores |
| **PDF report** | Personalized downloadable document | Cover with name, category analysis, recommendations |

**Copy patterns:**
- "Your [Topic] Score is [X]/[Total]. Here's what that means..."
- Low tier: "This area needs attention. Here are easy first steps... Our team specializes in helping people at your stage."
- High tier: "Excellent foundation! Focus on maintaining standards. We work with advanced clients like yourself on [specific advanced offer]."

**Ethical boundary:** Never inflate or deflate the computed score to steer a prospect toward the offer — the tier must reflect their actual answers.

See [references/technical-implementation.md](references/technical-implementation.md) when building the actual tool — scoring/weighting logic, conditional content rules, PDF generation, and platform comparison.

### 4. Sales and Marketing

**Core concept:** Turn assessment data into a systematic engine: promotion drives traffic to the landing page, while follow-up sequences segment leads by score tier and nurture them toward a conversion event.

**Why it works:** Scorecard leads arrive with self-reported pain points, qualification signals, and scores — sales conversations shift from discovery to recommendation, and automated segmentation gives every lead relevant follow-up.

**Key insights:**
- Promote via LinkedIn polls, Facebook/Google ads, email lists, podcast CTAs, book QR codes
- Fire the results email + PDF immediately after completion; send abandon emails to recover incomplete starts
- Segment nurture campaigns by tier — not one-size-fits-all drip
- Multi-step funnels for high-ticket: Stage 1 (8-15 questions, basic score), Stage 2 (15-25, detailed report), Stage 3 (30-50, baseline + roadmap)

**Product applications:**

| Context | Sales/Marketing Tactic | Example |
|---------|----------------------|---------|
| **Paid traffic** | Ads to landing page | "What's Your Leadership Score? Take the free quiz" |
| **Abandonment** | Recovery email sequence | "You started the quiz but didn't finish. Your progress is saved." |
| **Sales call** | Data-informed conversation | Rep opens with "I see you scored 4/10 on Operations..." |

**Copy patterns:**
- "Take the [Topic] Scorecard" as a universal CTA across all channels
- Results email: "Your [Topic] Score is ready. Here's what we recommend based on your results."
- Nurture: "Last week you scored [X] on [category]. Here are 3 ways to improve that score this month."

**Ethical boundary:** Never weaponize self-reported pain points to pressure a prospect — the data they volunteered is for tailoring help, not for manufacturing urgency.

See [references/analytics-optimization.md](references/analytics-optimization.md) when a live funnel underperforms or you're setting up tracking — key metrics, what to A/B test, funnel-drop analysis, CRM integration, and lead scoring.

## Scorecard Naming Strategy

**Effective names combine** topic clarity, outcome promise, and brevity.

**Formulas:**
- "The [Topic] Scorecard" — "The Business Growth Scorecard"
- "[Outcome] Readiness Assessment" — "Leadership Readiness Assessment"
- "What's Your [Topic] Score?" — "What's Your Marketing Score?"
- "The [Adjective] [Topic] Quiz" — "The Complete Wellness Quiz"

## Conversion Benchmarks

- Traditional PDF lead magnets: 3-10% conversion
- Scorecard/quiz funnels: 30-50% conversion
- Top performers: 70%+ with optimized landing pages

## Psychology Behind Why This Works

1. **Tension creation:** Questions surface dormant desires
2. **Reciprocity:** You gave value (insights), they're open to conversation
3. **Self-qualification:** They told you their problems and budget
4. **Personalization:** people willingly trade data for a tailored result, then expect the offer to match it (the supporting stats live in references/psychology.md)
5. **Gamification:** Primal drive to score, rank, and improve
6. **Commitment:** Time invested increases follow-through

## Implementation Checklist

1. [ ] Define ideal customer and their desired outcome
2. [ ] Choose a concept hook (one of the 5 types from the Landing Page section)
3. [ ] Write 2-7 scoring categories based on your methodology
4. [ ] Create 10-40 questions with point values
5. [ ] Set up 3 scoring tiers with dynamic content
6. [ ] Write landing page with 3 Cs (Clarity, Credibility, Connection)
7. [ ] Configure lead form fields
8. [ ] Set up automated email with results
9. [ ] Create follow-up sequence by tier
10. [ ] Test with 5-10 people before launch

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Fails | Fix |
|---------|-------------|------|
| **Too many questions for cold traffic** | Abandonment spikes after 15 questions | 8-15 questions cold; save 20-50 for warm leads |
| **Capturing email after the quiz** | Lose all abandon leads | Lead capture form before the first question |
| **Generic results for all tiers** | No personalization = no tension, no action | Unique dynamic content per tier per category |
| **Salesy questions** | "Are you ready to buy?" breaks trust | Frame around their situation, not your offer |
| **No clear CTA on results page** | Prospect gets score and leaves | Specific, tier-appropriate next step |
| **One-size-fits-all follow-up** | Low and high scorers need different offers | Segment nurture campaigns by score tier |
| **Skipping the concept hook** | Landing page has no pull | Test 3-5 hooks with your audience first |

## Quick Diagnostic

| Question | If No | Action |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Does the hook target a dormant desire? | Landing page underperforms | Rewrite using one of the 5 hook types (see Landing Page section) |
| Is email captured before questions? | Losing all abandon leads | Move lead capture before the questionnaire |
| Are questions grouped into scored categories? | Results feel arbitrary | Create 2-7 categories with point values |
| Does each tier have unique dynamic content? | Generic results, no tension | Write personalized insights and CTAs per tier |
| Is there a specific CTA per tier? | Prospects leave without converting | Map each tier to a next step (event, call, consultation) |
| Are follow-up emails segmented by score? | Nurture feels irrelevant | Separate sequences per tier with tailored content |
