# Drive Motivation Framework

Design motivation systems for products, teams, and organizations based on the science of what actually motivates humans — replacing carrot-and-stick thinking with intrinsic motivation.

## Core Principle

**The secret to high performance isn't rewards and punishment — it's the deeply human need to direct our own lives, learn and create new things, and do better for ourselves and our world.** For any task requiring even rudimentary cognitive effort, external rewards either don't work or actively worsen performance. Intrinsic motivation — Autonomy, Mastery, Purpose (AMP) — drives lasting engagement.

## Scoring

**Goal: 10/10.** Rate any motivation system (product features, team incentives, gamification, engagement loops) 0-10 against the AMP principles below. A 10/10 supports autonomy, enables mastery, and connects to purpose; lower scores indicate reliance on extrinsic rewards or controlling behaviors. Always state the current score and the specific improvements needed to reach 10/10.

## Motivation 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0

| Version | Core Assumption | Approach | Era |
|---------|----------------|----------|-----|
| **1.0** | Humans are biological | Survival drives | Pre-industrial |
| **2.0** | Humans respond to rewards/punishments | Carrot and stick | Industrial age |
| **3.0** | Humans seek autonomy, mastery, purpose | Intrinsic motivation | Knowledge economy |

Most organizations still run on Motivation 2.0 — fundamentally broken for modern cognitive work.

### The Seven Deadly Flaws of Extrinsic Rewards

"If-then" rewards ("If you do X, then you get Y"):

| Flaw | Mechanism | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **1. Extinguish intrinsic motivation** | Turns play into work | Kids paid to draw stopped drawing when payments stopped |
| **2. Diminish performance** | Narrow focus, reduce creativity | Candle problem: rewarded group performed worse |
| **3. Crush creativity** | Reward focus replaces exploration | Commissioned art rated less creative |
| **4. Crowd out good behavior** | Financial framing replaces moral framing | Day-care late fee: lateness increased (became a "service") |
| **5. Encourage cheating** | Goal fixation invites shortcuts | Wells Fargo fake accounts |
| **6. Become addictive** | Bigger rewards needed over time | Last year's bonus = this year's expectation |
| **7. Foster short-term thinking** | Optimize for the reward period | Quarterly bonuses → quarterly thinking |

**The boundary:** extrinsic rewards work only for routine, algorithmic tasks with no intrinsic interest. For creative work, complex problem-solving, or long-term engagement, they backfire.

See: [references/extrinsic-rewards.md](references/extrinsic-rewards.md) for the science behind reward failures.

## The Three Pillars: Autonomy, Mastery, Purpose

### 1. Autonomy

**Core concept:** The desire to direct our own lives — choice over what, when, how, and with whom. Autonomy ≠ independence: people can act with choice while staying interdependent with a team.

**The Four T's of Autonomy:**

| Dimension | Question | Example |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Task** | What do I work on? | Google's 20% time, Atlassian ShipIt days |
| **Time** | When do I work? | Flexible hours, no mandatory meetings |
| **Technique** | How do I do it? | Choose tools, methods, approach |
| **Team** | Who do I work with? | Self-forming teams |

**Product applications:**

| Context | Autonomy Killer | Autonomy Enabler |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Onboarding** | Forced linear tutorial | Choose your path, skip steps |
| **Content** | Algorithm-only feed | User-controlled feeds, filters |
| **Workflow** | Rigid process, feature bloat | Custom automations, show/hide, progressive disclosure |

**Autonomy audit:** can users choose WHAT to do, WHEN to engage, HOW to complete tasks, and their own path through the experience? "You must complete X before Y", unskippable tutorials, and mandatory notifications are violations.

See: [references/autonomy.md](references/autonomy.md) for autonomy design patterns.

### 2. Mastery

**Core concept:** The desire to get better at something that matters. Mastery is a mindset, not a destination — it's asymptotic, and the joy is in the pursuit.

**Three laws of mastery:**

- **Mastery is a mindset** — ability is developed, not fixed (Dweck's growth mindset). Frame failures as learning, not judgment.
- **Mastery is a pain** — it demands effort and deliberate practice. Flow (Csikszentmihalyi) lives between boredom and anxiety, so calibrate challenge to skill level.
- **Mastery is asymptotic** — users never fully arrive. Always offer a next level, next challenge.

**Flow conditions:** clear goals, immediate feedback, challenge/skill balance, sense of control.

**Product applications:**

| Context | Mastery Design | Example |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| **Progress** | Visible skill development | GitHub contribution graph, Duolingo levels |
| **Difficulty** | Adaptive challenge | Games that adjust to player skill |
| **Feedback** | Immediate, clear signals | Grammarly real-time writing analysis |

**Mastery audit:** can users see progress over time, get immediate feedback, and find a clear next step? Flat difficulty and punished failure are violations.

See: [references/mastery.md](references/mastery.md) for mastery design patterns and flow state principles.

### 3. Purpose

**Core concept:** The yearning to act in service of something larger than ourselves. Purpose is the context for the other two pillars — without it, autonomy is directionless and mastery hollow.

**Three expressions of purpose:**

| Expression | How It Manifests | Example |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| **Goals** | Purpose-driven objectives | TOMS: every purchase helps a person in need |
| **Words** | Language of purpose, not profit | "Associates" not "employees", "community" not "users" |
| **Policies** | Actions that demonstrate purpose | Patagonia: "Don't Buy This Jacket" |

**Product applications:**

| Context | Purpose Design | Example |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| **Impact** | Show the user's contribution | Wikipedia edit counter, Kiva lending impact |
| **Community** | Connect to something bigger | Open source contributions, community goals |
| **Values** | Align product with beliefs | Ecosia: "Search the web to plant trees" |

**Purpose audit:** does the user know WHY this exists, see their impact on something bigger, and find alignment with their values? Show aggregate impact ("Together, our users have saved 1M hours"), connect individual actions to collective outcomes, and celebrate meaningful milestones over vanity metrics.

See: [references/purpose.md](references/purpose.md) for purpose-driven design patterns.

## AMP Applied: Product Design

### Gamification Done Right vs. Wrong

| Principle | Bad (Extrinsic) | Good (Intrinsic) |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Autonomy** | Forced challenges, mandatory participation | Opt-in, chosen challenges |
| **Mastery** | Points for everything, trivial badges | Skill-based progression, meaningful milestones |
| **Purpose** | Pointless competition, discouraging leaderboards | Community contribution, personal growth |

**Example — Duolingo:** autonomy (choose language, pace, topics), mastery (adaptive difficulty, skill levels), purpose ("learn a language to connect with people"). Caution: streaks can shift from intrinsic mastery to extrinsic loss aversion.

### Team Motivation

| Principle | Manager Action | Example |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| **Autonomy** | Hand over task, time, technique, team | "Here's the goal. How you get there is up to you." |
| **Mastery** | Provide challenge, feedback, growth | Stretch assignments, mentorship, learning budget |
| **Purpose** | Connect work to mission | "Here's why this matters for our customers" |

### Compensation and Incentives

Pay people enough to take money off the table — fair, ideally above-market — then focus on AMP; beyond "enough," more money doesn't increase motivation. Prefer "now-that" rewards (unexpected recognition after the fact: "You hit target! Here's a bonus.") over "if-then" rewards ("If you hit target, you get a bonus"), which create pressure and short-term thinking.

See: [references/applications.md](references/applications.md) for product and team applications.

## Type I vs. Type X Behavior

| Type X (Extrinsic) | Type I (Intrinsic) |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| Fueled by external rewards | Fueled by autonomy, mastery, purpose |
| Seeks external recognition | Seeks inherent satisfaction |
| Short-term focus, fixed mindset | Long-term focus, growth mindset |

Design products and teams that cultivate Type I behavior: it's made, not born; it doesn't disdain money or recognition; it's renewable; and it promotes well-being.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Fails | Fix |
|---------|-------------|------|
| **Points for everything** | Crowds out intrinsic motivation | Reserve rewards for meaningful milestones |
| **Mandatory participation** | Kills autonomy | Make engagement opt-in |
| **Same challenge for everyone** | No flow — boredom or anxiety | Adaptive difficulty matching |
| **No visible progress** | Mastery is invisible | Progress indicators, skill tracking |
| **Missing "why"** | Actions feel meaningless | Connect every feature to purpose |
| **If-then bonuses** | Short-term thinking, gaming | Pay fairly; use "now-that" rewards; focus on AMP |

## Quick Diagnostic

Audit any motivation system:

| Question | If No | Action |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Can users choose what/when/how? | Autonomy violation | Add choices, flexibility, customization |
| Can users see their progress? | No mastery signal | Add progress tracking, skill levels |
| Is challenge matched to skill? | Boredom or anxiety | Implement adaptive difficulty |
| Is there immediate feedback? | Can't improve | Add real-time response to actions |
| Does the user know WHY this matters? | No purpose | Connect to mission, show impact |
| Are we using "if-then" rewards? | Extrinsic crowding-out | Switch to "now-that" or intrinsic design |
