description: Strategic framework for discovering and designing product innovations based on Clayton Christensen's Jobs to Be Done (JTBD) theory from "Competing Against Luck". Use when you need to: (1) understand customers' true motivations, (2) design a new product or feature, (3) conduct customer discovery interviews, (4) analyze competition through the "jobs" lens, (5) diagnose why a product isn't selling or customers are churning, (6) create positioning strategy, (7) build a jobs-oriented organization.

# Jobs to Be Done Framework

Framework for discovering innovation based on a fundamental truth: customers don't buy products - they "hire" them to do a specific job in their lives.

## Fundamental Principle

**Job to Be Done** = the progress a customer wants to make in specific circumstances.

Key elements of the definition:
- **Progress** (not goal, not solution) - customer wants to move from current state to a better one
- **Circumstances** - context determines the job, not customer attributes (demographics are useless)
- **Hiring/Firing** - customer actively chooses a product for the "job"

## Three Dimensions of Every Job

Every job has three inseparable dimensions - omitting any means failure:

| Dimension | Question | Example (milkshake) |
|-----------|----------|---------------------|
| **Functional** | What does the customer need to do? | Occupy myself during boring commute |
| **Emotional** | How do they want to feel? | Have a small treat for myself |
| **Social** | How do they want to be perceived? | As a sensible parent (not buying donuts) |

## Forces of Progress

The decision to "hire" a new product results from four forces:

**PRO-change forces:**
1. **Push** - frustration with current situation ("this annoys me")
2. **Pull** - attraction of new solution ("I want this")

**ANTI-change forces:**
3. **Habit** - attachment to current ("I've always done it this way")
4. **Anxiety** - fear of the new ("what if it doesn't work?")

Change only happens when: `Push + Pull > Habit + Anxiety`

**Implication:** Often it's more effective to reduce anxiety and habit than to increase push/pull.

## Big Hire vs Little Hire

Two decision moments:

| | Big Hire | Little Hire |
|--|----------|-------------|
| **What** | Purchase/signup decision | Decision to use in the moment |
| **When** | Once | Repeatedly |
| **Risk** | Product is never used | Product is abandoned |
| **Focus** | Marketing, onboarding | Product, UX, retention |

**Critical:** Winning the Big Hire doesn't guarantee the Little Hire. Many products lose at the Little Hire stage.

## Discovering Jobs - Methodology

### Signals Indicating an Undiscovered Job

1. **Workarounds** - people tinker, hack, combine products
2. **Non-consumption** - people opt out of entire category
3. **Compensating behaviors** - "I buy X but then need Y and Z too"
4. **Negative emotions** - frustration, shame, fear with current solutions

### Job Interview - Discovery Questions

Don't ask directly "what do you need" - customers don't know. Investigate the **purchase timeline**:

**First thoughts:**
- "When did you first think about looking for a solution?"
- "What was happening in your life then?"
- "What was frustrating you?"

**Search:**
- "What alternatives did you look for?"
- "What eliminated options?"
- "Who did you talk to about this decision?"

**Purchase moment:**
- "Where were you? What were you doing?"
- "What ultimately convinced you to decide?"
- "What were you afraid of?"

**Usage:**
- "Is the product doing what you expected?"
- "What surprised you?"
- "What's still missing?"

### Job Statement - Format

```
When _____________ [circumstances/situation]
I want to ______________ [progress to achieve]  
so I can ________ [outcome/benefit]
```

Example: "When I'm driving alone to work in the morning and have a boring hour ahead, I want something to keep my hands busy and satisfy my hunger, so I'm not hungry until lunch and have a small pleasure to start my day."

## Competition Through the Jobs Lens

**True competition** is everything a customer can "hire" for the same job - often from completely different categories.

Examples of non-obvious competition:
- Milkshake competes with: banana, bagel, boredom, podcast
- Netflix competes with: TikTok, sleep, family conversation, games
- Online course competes with: book, YouTube, mentoring, doing nothing

**Strategic implication:** Analyze competitors through jobs lens, not product categories.

## Integration vs Modularization

When job is poorly understood → **integrate** (control entire experience)
When job is well understood → **modularize** (specialize components)

Rule: Integrate where performance is "not good enough" for the job. Modularize where it's "good enough."

## Building an Organization Around Jobs

### Jobs-Oriented Metrics

Instead of measuring:
- Customer satisfaction → Measure: **whether the job got done**
- NPS → Measure: **reasons for hiring and firing**
- Feature usage → Measure: **progress on the job**

### Decision Structure

Every product decision should answer: "Will this help the customer better accomplish their job?"

If you can't answer this question - you don't understand the job yet.
